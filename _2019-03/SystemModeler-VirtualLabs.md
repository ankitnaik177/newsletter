How can you make teaching come alive and be more engaging? For many educators, the answer turns out to be not so much a single solution, but rather a set of tools that can vary according to subject and even by student. Wolfram has now added a new tool to the pedagogical toolkit: Wolfram Virtual Labs.

These are:

- Open education resources (OER).
- Designed to encourage student curiosity by allowing students to test ideas with immediate feedback in a programmatic environment.
- Created to make memorization easier.

The following Virtual Labs libraries are now available for download from the SystemModeler library store:

- CollegeThermal: Developed in collaboration with Politecnico di Torino. Contains interactive thermal labs related to heat transfer and thermal engineering courses.
- HighSchoolBiology: Developed in collaboration with Linköping University and VicSTEM. Contains interactive biology labs related to cell transport phenomena, population models and food metabolism.
- HighSchoolChemistry: Developed in collaboration with Linköping University Contains interactive chemistry labs related to rate laws, homogenous reactions and heterogenous reactions.

Stay tuned for upcoming libraries, including:

- HighSchoolPhysics
- CollegeElectricalAnalog
- CollegeMechanicalEngineering

The labs are developed using Mathematica notebooks with Modelica models running in the background. For more information, please read the CollegeThermal release blog.
