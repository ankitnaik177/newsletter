The following new Virtual Labs’ library is now available for download from the [System Modeler library store](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/):

[CollegeBiology](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/college-biology/): Developed in collaboration with [Linköping university](https://liu.se/) contains interactive biology labs related to PCR, electrophoresis and autosomal recessive disease.

The labs are developed using Mathematica notebooks with Modelica models running in the background. For more information please read [this blog](https://blog.wolfram.com/2019/10/08/powering-engineering-education-with-wolfram-virtual-labs/).
